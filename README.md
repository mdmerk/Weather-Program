# Weather-Program
Ruby program that uses a few different APIs to retrieve the 7 day weather forecast for the location of the computer running it.


Once you open the program file in the code editor of your choice, use an extension/package (such as Atom Runner) to run the script. Shortly after doing this, the output will display the weather forecast for your location for the next 7 days!
